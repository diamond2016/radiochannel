 That's an excellent architectural question, and it's one of the most common decisions to make when designing a Spring Boot application.

  To give you the direct answer: The typical and strongly recommended best practice is to use separate classes for your database entities and your API Data Transfer
  Objects (DTOs).

  You should not use a single, heavily annotated class for both purposes. While it might seem faster initially, it leads to significant problems down the road.

  Here is a breakdown of the recommended architecture and why it's the standard approach.

  Recommended Architecture

   1. `domain` (or `entities`) package: This is where your JPA entities live.
       * Classes here are annotated with @Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, @Column, and relationship annotations (@ManyToOne, @ManyToMany, etc.).
       * Their sole purpose is to represent the state of your data in the database. They model the database schema.
       * Example: radiochannel/src/main/java/it/diamondnet/springframework/radiochannel/domain/RadioStation.java

   2. `dto` package: This is where your Data Transfer Objects live.
       * These are plain Java objects (POJOs). They might have validation annotations (@NotBlank, @Size) if they are used for input, but they do not have any JPA or
         persistence-related annotations.
       * Their purpose is to define the "shape" of the data being sent to or from your API. They are your API's public contract.
       * Example: radiochannel/src/main/java/it/diamondnet/springframework/radiochannel/dto/RadioStationDto.java

   3. `mapper` package: This package contains classes responsible for converting between Entities and DTOs.

  Why This Separation is Crucial (The "Why")

   1. Separation of Concerns: Your API (the "view" of your data) and your database schema (the "storage" of your data) are two different concerns. They should be able
      to evolve independently. You might want to refactor your database tables for performance, but that should not break the public contract of your REST API.

   2. API Contract Stability: Your DTOs define a stable contract for your API clients. If you expose your entities directly, any change to the database entity (like
      renaming a column or changing a relationship) immediately becomes a breaking change for your API consumers.

   3. Security: Entities often contain fields that should not be exposed to the outside world (e.g., internal flags, timestamps managed by the database, or
      relationships to other sensitive data). Using DTOs ensures you only expose the fields you explicitly choose.

   4. Avoiding Lazy Loading & Performance Issues: JPA entities often use lazy loading for relationships to improve performance. If you serialize an entity directly to
      JSON and a lazy-loaded collection is accessed, it can either trigger unexpected database queries or, more commonly, throw a LazyInitializationException because
      the database session is already closed.

   5. Preventing Infinite Recursion: With bidirectional relationships (e.g., a RadioStation has a list of Genres, and a Genre has a list of RadioStations), serializing
      an entity directly to JSON will cause an infinite loop and a stack overflow. DTOs break this cycle.

  How to Implement It (The "How")

  Here is the typical workflow for a POST request to create a new radio station:

   1. Controller: The @RestController receives a RadioStationDto in the request body.

   1     @PostMapping
   2     public ResponseEntity<RadioStationDto> createRadioStation(@RequestBody RadioStationDto radioStationDto) {
   3         RadioStationDto savedDto = radioStationService.create(radioStationDto);
   4         return new ResponseEntity<>(savedDto, HttpStatus.CREATED);
   5     }

   2. Service: The service layer contains the business logic.
       * It accepts the RadioStationDto.
       * It uses a mapper to convert the RadioStationDto into a RadioStation entity.
       * It uses the RadioStationRepository to save the entity to the database.
       * The repository returns the saved entity (now with a generated ID).
       * It uses the mapper again to convert the saved RadioStation entity back into a RadioStationDto.
       * It returns the RadioStationDto to the controller.

  How to Handle the Mapping

  You have two main options for the entity-DTO conversion:

   1. Manual Mapping: Create a simple class with static methods. This is fine for small projects but can become tedious.

   1     // In a new class like RadioStationMapper.java
   2     public static RadioStation toEntity(RadioStationDto dto) {
   3         // manual conversion...
   4     }
   5
   6     public static RadioStationDto toDto(RadioStation entity) {
   7         // manual conversion...
   8     }

   2. Use a Library (Recommended): Libraries like MapStruct are excellent for this. MapStruct is a compile-time code generator, so it's extremely fast and requires
      very little boilerplate.
       * You define an interface, and MapStruct generates the implementation for you during compilation.

   1     // In a new interface in the 'mapper' package
   2     @Mapper(componentModel = "spring")
   3     public interface RadioStationMapper {
   4         RadioStation toEntity(RadioStationDto dto);
   5         RadioStationDto toDto(RadioStation entity);
   6     }

  Next Steps for Your Project

  So, to answer your question directly: Yes, you should create new classes in a `domain` package.

   1. Rename your current model package to dto.
   2. Create a new domain package.
   3. Copy the classes from dto to domain.
   4. Annotate the classes in the domain package with @Entity, @Id, etc., to turn them into proper JPA entities.
   5. Keep the classes in the dto package as plain objects. You might want to add Dto as a suffix to the class names (e.g., RadioStationDto) for clarity, which is a
      very common convention.

  This approach will give you a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture. Would you like me to start by refactoring one of the classes, for example, Genre, to
  show you how this would look in practice?
